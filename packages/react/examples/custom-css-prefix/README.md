## Getting Started

First, run `yarn` or `npm install` and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Ensure that you have executed `yarn build` or `npm run build` in the root
directory of your project before running `yarn start` or `npm run start`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
