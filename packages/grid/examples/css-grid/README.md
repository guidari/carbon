## Getting Started

First, run `yarn` or `npm install` and then run the development server:

```bash
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

Ensure that you have executed `yarn build` or `npm run build` in the root
directory of your project before running `yarn develop` or `npm run develop`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
